Day 1 : 
-> CI/CD -- Continous Integration and Continous Development 
    a tool that automates the steps from development to deployment. 
    helps team engineering team build and release software much faster

-> Create IAM user - best practise for account security 

-> Launch a new EC2 instance.

-> Set up a key pai for a secure access 

-> Set up network settings for your instance 

What is SSH?
SSH i.e. Secure Shell is a protocol used to make sure only authorized users can access a remote server. When you connect to your EC2 instance later in this project, SSH verifies you have the correct private key that matches the public key on the server.
SSH is also a type of network traffic.
 Once SSH has authorized you, it'll set up a secure connection between you and the EC2 instance. 
 All data transferred (including your commands and the responses from the instance) gets encrypted. 
 This encryption makes SSH an ideal method for working with virtual servers!


-> What is a terminal?
A terminal is where you send instructions to your computer using text instead of clicks


We're navigating the terminal so that it can get into the DevOps folder that's storing your .pem file, so we can run commands to connect to your instance next.
 accessing the .pem file 
icacls "devops_prac_keypair.pem" /reset
icacls "devops_prac_keypair.pem" /grant:r "sahithi\18102:R"
icacls "devops_prac_keypair.pem" /inheritance:r 

icals-- Integrity Control Access Control Lists  
     - tool for windows to decide who can open and change files on system 


now let's connect to EC2 instance 

my instance public ipv4 dns -- ec2-3-143-242-208.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
path to .pem file -- C:\Users\18102\Desktop\ci-cd-webapp-on-aws\devops\devops_prac_keypair.pem

** connect instance via SSH: 
ssh -i C:\Users\18102\Desktop\ci-cd-webapp-on-aws\devops\devops_prac_keypair.pem ec2-user@ ec2-3-143-242-208.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
